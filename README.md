Heart Disease Risk Analysis & Prediction   
  
- Project Overview  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of heart disease risk factors using Python. We leverage data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to uncover insights from the Heart Disease UCI dataset. This project is designed to showcase advanced data analytics and healthcare domain knowledge.
  
- KEY HIGHLIGHTS:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover trends in heart disease prevalence across age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more.  
- Comparative Analysis: Identify which risk factors (chest pain, blood pressure, exercise angina, etc.) are most correlated with heart disease.  
- Predictive Modeling: Implement Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers to predict heart disease presence.  
- Interactive Visualizations: Utilize Plotly to create dynamic charts that make data exploration engaging for users and recruiters.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
🔹 Age Distribution & Heart Disease Prevalence – Understand the age-related risks.  
🔹 Gender-Based Analysis – Are males more prone to heart disease?  
🔹 Correlation Heatmap – Identify which factors strongly correlate with heart disease.

3. Comparative Risk Analysis
🔸 Chest Pain vs. Heart Disease – Which chest pain type is the biggest warning sign?  
🔸 Exercise-Induced Angina Impact – Does experiencing angina during exercise indicate higher risk?  
🔸 Thalassemia & Heart Disease – How does genetic blood disorder impact cardiac health?
